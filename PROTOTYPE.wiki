Web API
- In order to implement all of the components of our proposed web application, we will need data from the following public API.

- To obtain a large set of event data, we are using the TicketMaster Web API. We will be making GET requests to “/discovery/v2/events” and filter our search by location, date, availability, and much more depending on user input.
